# VECTOR — Movement Intelligence Platform

Real-time multi-modal movement tracker for NYC and global air traffic. Track live aircraft positions (OpenSky Network), Citi Bike station availability, and NYC MTA subway status — all in a single tactical command interface with a NASA mission control aesthetic.

## Setup

Run the setup script to install dependencies, initialize the database, and seed it with demo data:

```bash
npm run setup
```

## Development

Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Using CodeYam Editor

This project was built with [CodeYam](https://codeyam.com). To launch the editor:

```bash
codeyam editor
```

The editor provides a live preview alongside a Claude Code terminal for iterating on the app.

## Database

This project uses SQLite via Prisma. Common commands:

```bash
npm run db:push    # Apply schema changes and generate Prisma client
npm run db:seed    # Seed the database with demo data
npm run db:reset   # Reset database: drop, recreate, and re-seed
```
